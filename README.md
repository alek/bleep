A MIDI-driven Vector Graphics Livecoding Framework

## Getting Started

Getting started should be fairly straightforward. The only dependency is on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 8.0 or higher). 

After installing node, you can use npm to download all the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```
and the system should be ready to use. Bleep.live works best with a MIDI controller, but the easiest way to get started is by running it in the "virtual midi" mode:

```
node bin/www --virtualmidi
```

Once the server is up and running, you can access it from your browser of choice at:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

You will see a master controller window with a preloaded sample graphics:

By using qwerty/asdfgh keyboard keys you can simulate sending MIDI CC signals and observe changes to the rendered object.

Now that you have Bleep up & running, let's get into the weeds of how to make it useful...
